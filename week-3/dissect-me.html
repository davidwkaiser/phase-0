<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?aside from the basics of the skeleton (head, body, etc), I find that I use p and ul / ol a fair bit. In this challenge we used p to mark paragraphs, we put the whole thing in a wrapper of main and we put each bit of blog text within a set of article tags, each with its own heading (h1)


How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
my understanding is that the browser parses the html page in a "breadth first" manner and then as each layer of nodes is parsed, the browser then parses the children of thos nodes, then the children of those nodes, etc, and any inheritance and conflicts are resolved during each layer of parsing.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

snippets are awesome! I love the idea of templates. I hate recreating the wheel. I am sure I will create more snippets, once I am using more types of docs (i.e. ruby files, rails files, python, etc). I have not researched any existing snippets, but since you mentioned it, I will!

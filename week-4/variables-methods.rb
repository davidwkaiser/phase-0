# How do you define a local variable?
#   It is a device which "points" to a value. local means it is within the scope of something, which can be a method, loop or even the whole program
# How do you define a method?
#   A Method is like a verb, it is an action which acts upon the object it is called upon.
# What is the difference between a local variable and a method?
#   It's like the difference between a noun and a verb. One is the object of the action, the other is the action. (as a linguist, I like this metaphor)
# How do you run a ruby program from the command line?
#   type ruby program_name.rb, hit ENTER
# How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?
#   type rspec program_name.rb
# What was confusing about this material? What made sense?
#   All fairly clear. In fact, the only confusing bit was where to submit the links within the assignment page(s).

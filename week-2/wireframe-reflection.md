**What is a wireframe?**
It is typically a non-working mock up of the site, so we can see how it will look before spending all of the time coding it up.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**
We can change design elements quickly and easily before coding, this saves time in both the design and development stage.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**
At first, no, learning to use the wireframing site was frustrating. Once I got accustomed to it, it was fun. I'm sensing a theme with that (similar to Git)

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**
I went through several minor variations of a first idea, then stuck with that once I was happy with it.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**
I had questions about how to wireframe. I found enough answers to work within the DBC assignment.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**
I enjoyed the wireframing once I got used to it, once it was less frustrating and scary. I got really annoyed and frustrated with Git at one point, when it didn't seem to be committing my changes. Once I figured that it, I felt better. I had to remember not to take git's refusals personally, the problem was me, I was in the wrong directory

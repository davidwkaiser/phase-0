# Think About Time Reflection
I am familiar with most of the above resources. I began a journey of learning about time management and productivity almost ten years ago, because my systems for time management were so awful and creating such dire consequences in my life. I studied Getting Things Done, Stephen Covey, Pomodoro, I saw Thomas Duhigg speak at SxSW and bought his book, I saw BJ Fogg there as well, and I signed up for his newsletter. I have been on Ramit Sethi's newsletter forever and I admire his insight and wit. As an Executive Coach, I coached many of my clients around time management, and I even developed my own theories on the topic. For example, I believe that time management is very personal, there is no one "best practice." I believe that procrastination is a result of how we FEEL about the task, and how we feel depends on the stories we tell ourselves about the task. I believe that habits are incredibly important, and I believe that there are methods of time management that work specifically for creative work.

Time Boxing is about setting a specific amount of time to work on something, in order to make progress, without necessarily finishing, then allowing for rest / renewal and evaluation of work. It can prevent someone from banging their head on a problem unproductively ("doom loop"), and it allows us to recharge periodically. I will use it in Phase Zero to manage limited time  to complete tasks, given that I also have work, family, etc. I amusing Time Boxing right now. The instructions suggested we work on this for no more than one hour, so I set a timer on my phone, and I check it periodically.

Currently, I set a plan for the week every Monday. I set five major goals for the week, plus one minor goal for each of eight areas of my life (idea from Morgana Rae). I track completion of these goals daily. Also, each morning, I create a to-do list of work and personal tasks, and I star the ones that are critical for that day. I check my list throughout the day. I use Google Calendar to track appointments and to block off time. I have an accountability buddy for my most critical and / or onerous task of the week, I speak to him by phone every Monday, and I am part of a men's group that I lean on for accountability and support. I meditate at least five days per week, and set aside time for visualization and internal reflection daily.

My system is working very well, as a time and task management system. I am doing a very good job of staying accountable in my life, to others in particular. Where it can break down is that I can get overly focused on DOING, and I fail to put attention into BEING and ENJOYING, so I am very productive, but sometimes not having a lot of fun. This is a growth edge for me right now and I am working on this with my mentor.

As previously discussed, I am currently using several of the methodologies mentioned above (meditation, habit formation, starting small, etc). I am open to more, and I am also open to helping the members of my cohort if they want help identifying systems that work for them, or feelings or beliefs that are hindering them.

My overall plan is to keep doing what I am doing and evaluate how it's working. If it continues to work, great, I can allow for some minor modifications and keep going. If I encounter obstacles or failures, I will seek the source of the problem and a solution, reaching out to my cohort mates or to outside support as appropriate.

At this point, my major concern is that I have a business trip in week two for several days, in which it will be difficult or impossible to be online. My current plan is to sketch out my work flow for week two as much as possible in advance, to schedule pairing sessions and any other external commitments early in the week, and to put in extra time, late at night if necessary, before I go. I can even go to work late on Monday morning if necessary. This plan is not sustainable, I don't want to function on low sleep for long, but I shouldn't have to, things revert to normal in week three.


# Command Line Reflection

The "shell" is another way of accessing the operating system outside of the Graphical User Interface (GUI), via command line. I have a Macbook running OSX El Capitan, so for me that's Bash, although there are alternatives like zsh. I grew up using various versions of DOS on home computers and linux at school, this idea is familiar to me, even though the commands differ.

Most difficult was pushd and popd. I had to go through that a bunch of times to figure out the mechanics of where I was and where I would go next. Most of the rest was familiar, even if a bit rusty.

I was able to get all of the commands working. I made some typos, so I had to clean up files, or file names. A bit frustrating at first, but it actually helped to solidify the learning.

PWD and CD are important, to know where the user is located, and to change from there to a desired location. ls is helpful to know what is located in the directory.

pwd print working directory

ls list all files and directories, ls -lr is important, to show the permissions for the file

mv means "move," but it is more useful for renaming files

cd change directory, to move around

../ I believe this is go up two directories in the hierarchy

touch create a file

mkdir make a new directory

less print out the data (a file for example) to the screen, one page at a time

rmdir remove / delete a directory

rm remove / delete a file

help open up the man pages to review the documentation



# Forking and Cloning Reflection

To create a new repo, go to the directory you want to use as the parent and type git init NAME, where NAME is the name you will give to the directory.

There is a "fork" button on both the GitHub website and on GitHub for Desktop, clicking this allows us to create a fork in the current branch

to clone a repo, type git clone https://www.github.com/ownername/reponame to clone a github repo named reponame that belongs to ownername. the link to use can be found at github, just below the green line, under where it says "releases"

We fork a repository in order to create a separate branch we can work on, with the intention that if all goes well, we will merge it back into the master and have an updated master.

I managed to read through Git / GitHub and get everything installed. I must admit I am very tentative, bordering on anxious, using it. Tracking and filing and maintaining logistical control of things is a weak spot and source of concern for me. I am confident that I can learn this in a group setting, and Git / GitHub does seem pretty intuitive, which is reassuring, but at the moment, I am pretty worried about misplacing files, or creating inefficient file hierarchies that will be a pain to change later, etc.

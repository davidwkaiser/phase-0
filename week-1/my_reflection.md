5. Web Basics Assignment and Reflection

Part 1: Based on the resources you looked at, describe the terms you learned about.

Browser:  software that allows us to read a website
DNS:      domain name server, it's like a phonebook that knows which 'name' addresses coorespond to which IP addresses
Domain:   the 'name' of a website, like 'www.github.com'
Internet: a set of protocols and hardware that connects machines together for communications
IP address: a set of 4 three-digit numbers that is like the "phone number" which corresponds to a domain name
Web app:    software located at a web site which is interactive. It may contain a database or other software which responds to user interaction
Web server: computer software and hardware that is hooked up to the internet and which can receive and respond to signals from the internet
Website:  usually a webiste which is fairly static, like a marketing 'brochure,' unlike a more interactive web app
World wide web:
Explain how the internet displays your website after you push your changes. we push changes, which are some text, wrapped in HTML, so the browser can interpret them
the page is assigned an IP address, and when we point the browser to the domain name for the page, the DNS servers point to the server for the host, which resolves the request for the specific page, and displays the content, as marked up by HTML, to the browser

Part 2: Reflection

What 2 new things did you learn about the web? 1> the web is not the internet. 2> more details about home DNS servers work. 
How did you feel when you saw your web page live?   pretty cool, although I have created pages before, mostly with WordPress. Always nice to see a product though
Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified? Good to understand 'under the hood' a bit more. this was mostly familiar, nice to flesh it out though
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

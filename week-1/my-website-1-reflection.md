Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Find a friend who likes computers. Offer a craft beer or a nice bottle of wine if the friend creates a repo and clones it down to your computer. When you're done, go enjoy the drink together!

If that fails, asuming you have an account at github, go to your page, click on the "repositories" tab. On the far right is a nice green "new" button. You will give your repository a name. Choose something descriptive of your project like "new-website." click the green "create repository" button below. You're done! Now copy the address. You can do this by finding a button labeled "HTTPS," there is an address to the right of that, copy it.

To clone the repository, open the command terminal on your computer (a little black box with a ">_" in the upper left), this gives you the command line. type "pwd" to learn what directory you are in. then type "ls" to see what else is in that directory. create a new directory by typing "mkdir DIRECTORY-NAME" with the name you want for the directory instead of the CAPS. then type cd DIRECTORY-NAME. Then type "git clone" and paste the link you copied earlier. After you hit ENTER, you may need to input your github username and password. You're done!

Describe what open source means.
"Open Source" means that it is possible to view the source code behind a program (like looking under the hood of a car to see the engine and how it works). Different open source licenses and agreements allow users varying types of use for the code and for any products derived from it.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open source has allowed the creation and dissemination of many useful products, not least of which is Linux and Git (thanks Linus!). It is a wonderful way of sharing products with the world. I would imagine that it is important to set expectations, if I create something that is open source, I will probably not make any money on it (although Linus Torvalds has done very well for himself), that's OK, if I want to make and sell a product, there are other ways to do that. Open source is a great way of "sharing your toys" with the world.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
My understanding is that using a license makes it clear what (if any) rights other potential users have. This reduces ambiguity, protects the rights of the creator (to varying degrees) and also sets expectations about use, so that the creator doesn't spend all of his / her time fielding questions about license, copyright, etc.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Git is terrifying, because the underlying concept of maintaining control over versions depends on a personal weakness, and it took a while to figure out conceptually how Git works. I suspect that as I get comfortable with it, I will probably love it because it does the work that I dislike / fear. For the moment I worry about setting up directories in the wrong place, overwriting things, breaking things, etc. As I follow the instructions, even when I don't completely understand, I find it gets easier by doing.
